I'm a graduate from the Honors Bachelor of Comp Sci. Mobile Computing program from <a href="https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-computer-science-mobile-computing">Sheridan College</a>.
<br></br>
I have worked with an array of programming languages as well as multiple IDE's. My capstone work was focused primarily on iOS, however I am happy working with any technologies. Most recently I have been working 
on improving my overall web stack and am actively developing web applications as well as games with C# and Godot.
<br></br>
I have nearly <b>4 years</b> of Quality Assurance experience through my time at Eyecarrot (Binovi), Q4 Inc., and Game Hive! I have experience with testing on multiple platforms and varying project sizes. I am most familiar with Web, iOS, and Android testing, but am
 always open to learn more! 
<br></br>
For more details on some of the work I have done please read through some of my <a href="/portfolio/">Experiences</a>. If you have any questions about any of them please reach out!
<br></br>
For information on how to contact me please visit my <a href="/contact/">Contact Info</a> page.

<b>Note:</b> Some of my work on Github has been privated. Certain work from research teams I have been on cannot be public due to NDA so if you are curious about something
specific please contact me about it.
