I'm a graduate from the Honors Bachelor of Comp Sci. Mobile Computing program from <a href="https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-computer-science-mobile-computing">Sheridan College</a>.
<br></br>
I have worked with an array of programming languages as well as multiple IDE's. My capstone work was focused primarily on iOS, however I am happy working with any platform. Most recently I have been working 
on learning web development.
<br></br>
I have over <b>3 years</b> of Quality Assurance experience through my time at Eyecarrot (Binovi) and Q4 Inc.! I have experience with testing on multiple platforms and varying project sizes. I am most familiar with Web, iOS, and Android testing, but am
 always open to learn more! 
<br></br>
<b>Currently looking for work! Please read about my last few years at <a href="/portfolio/q4inc/">Q4 Inc</a> as a QA Tester!</b>
<br></br>
For more details on some of the work I have done please read through some of my <a href="/portfolio/">Experiences</a>. If you have any questions about any of them please reach out!
<br></br>
For information on how to contact me please visit my <a href="/contact/">Contact Info</a> page.
<br></br>
<b>Note:</b> A lot of my work on Github has been privated. Certain work from research teams I have been on cannot be public due to NDA's so if you are curious about something
specific please contact me about it.
