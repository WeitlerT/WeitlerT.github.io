I'm a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Comp Sci. Mobile Computing program from Sheridan College.

I have worked with quite the array of programming languages as well as multiple IDE's and platforms. My capstone work was focused primarily on iOS and Android. I have spent a lot of time with AI/Machine learning through my research work (just under a year) as well as Quality Assurance through my internship work.
