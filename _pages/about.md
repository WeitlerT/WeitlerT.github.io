I'm a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Comp Sci. Mobile Computing program from [Sheridan College](https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-computer-science-mobile-computing)

I have worked with an array of programming languages as well as multiple IDE's. My capstone work was focused primarily on iOS, however I am happy working with any platform.

I have spent a fair amount of time with AI/Machine learning through my research work (just under a year of studies/work) as well as Quality Assurance through my internship work.
