I'm a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Comp Sci. Mobile Computing program from [Sheridan College](https://www.google.com)

I have worked with quite the array of programming languages as well as multiple IDE's. My capstone work was focused primarily on iOS and Android, however I comfortable with multiple platforms.

I have spent a fair amount of time with AI/Machine learning through my research work (just under a year of studies/work) as well as Quality Assurance through my internship work. For more details on some of the work I have done please check out my Experiences page.
