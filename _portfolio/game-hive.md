During my tenure at Game Hive, I gained extensive knowledge of the game development process and the intricacies of testing through Unity. My role involved building and submitting our iOS builds, which allowed me to oversee the entire processâ€”from testing new features and collaborating with developers to resolve bugs, to ultimately submitting our builds for release on the app stores.

I had the opportunity to work on their biggest mobile game Tap Titans 2, which has over 10m+ downloads on the app store! I also got to work with various technologies, and also deepened my understanding of Unity and mobile testing, which were relatively new to me. Additionally, I became quite proficient in using Jira for tracking bugs and issues. Despite the brevity of my time at Game Hive, I learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed working with such a talented team.
