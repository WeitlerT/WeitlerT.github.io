We had an assignment in our telecommunications course to create a Wikipedia page hosted through our Google Cloud and using Juju to manage it. We used CLI on Linux to set up all required permissions for the Cloud as well as the tools/API's we needed such as the compute engine API. In this course we did almost all of our work through command line on Linux so I got a decent amount of experience using it and assigning permissions through it.
