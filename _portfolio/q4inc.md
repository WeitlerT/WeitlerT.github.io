For our HCI course we had to create an application that would simplify a pre-existing concept. We figured the periodic table would be interesting to put into a mobile application format. A key part of this course was making an application that anyone could use with no prior experience or knowledge. In other words it has to be intuitive, functional, and most importantly simple to understand. We created a periodic table, color coated it, and gave each cell in the table an onClick action. When tapping on any of the elements you would be taken to a page explaining that element you tapped on. The screenshots below show the different pages of the application.
