I was hired as a QA Tester at Q4 Inc. and worked there for just shy of 3 years (35 months to be exact!). My primary duties put simply were to ensure a website built by our developers were as bug free and as close to the design provided as possible. Our usual testing process had 3 major phases: System testing (initial testing), Pre-Production testing (generally done shortly before site goes out), and Post launch testing (done after site has gone live). As the QA of our team I had to work very closely with the devs and implementation managers to ensure bugs were adressed properly and the site matched the design provided by our design team. We followed an agile development process and held a standup meeting with our team every morning to discuss what we did, what we plan to do, as well as any blockers holding us up. For project management and time tracking I have worked with Mavenlink, Asana, and Jira while at Q4.

I worked with a variety of different technologies while at Q4 and became pretty comfortable using chrome dev tools to navigate through sites to resolve and find certain bugs. I also began studying HTML/CSS/Javascript while at the company in hopes of moving to a developer role eventually. This also helped strengthen my skillset as a QA.

I have worked on hundreds of clients sites varying greatly in sizes. As the first QA hire I was able to help out my team lead with documentation and processes for the future of our QA department. I helped train many of the new QA hires during my time at Q4 and had the oppurtunity to work with a lot of amazing people. Due to COVID our company went remote so I learnt to work in a remote environment with over 2 years of experience doing so.

Although QA was my primary role I also had the oppurtunity to help out our support team during heavy earning seasons. This required communicating directly with clients and working quickly to resolve their issues. These issues ranged anywhere from simple content changes to more complex Javascript fixes. Most issues I adressed were smaller HTML or CSS fixes, but it taught me how to work quickly under pressure. 

Overall I learnt a plethora of things during my time at Q4 and if you have any more questions about my experiences there please contact me!
