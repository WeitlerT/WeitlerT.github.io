Tim Cook the CEO of Apple visited Sheridan College to see the innovative mobile application projects we had been working on in the Sheridan Computer Science - Mobile Computing program. He asked us about our opinions on utilizing xCode and writing in Swift and wanted to know if we had any suggestions to improve either.
