During our AI course we were tasked with building some type of project utilizing Matlab and AI/ML techologies. My partner Nick happened to have a Raspberry Pi car kit which we decided we could use for a small scale self-driving car project. It came equipped with a camera which we wanted to use to stream a live feed from the car to our laptop running Matlab. We decided we would attempt to have the car move around a track and stop if it found a boundary (in this case our boundry was just white sheets of paper).
